Syntax Highlighting for coreboot devicetree.cb files in vim

These keywords were gathered from coreboot's [util/sconfig/sconfig.l](http://review.coreboot.org/gitweb?p=coreboot.git;a=blob;f=util/sconfig/sconfig.l) file.

## Installation
To add the grammar manually under linux, place the ftdetect and syntax
directories and their contents into your ~/.vim directory
